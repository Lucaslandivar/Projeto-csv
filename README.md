<h2>Description of the project</h2>
<p>I made this project to practice my HTML and CSS skills, making a website for a comunity wich i work with.
In this project, i make a home page for the comunity, i put a lot of information about the comunity using articles and i add the instagram and youtube logo for the links.
This project took me some time, because i was still learning HTML and CSS, but was a good way to start my journey.<p/>
